# Optimal_Scheulde_ER-positive

This repository contains the code for the paper: "Mathematical modeling identifies optimum palbociclib-fulvestrant dose administration schedules for the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients."

The following folders are included in this repository:

"PD_model_nonDOXcells": This folder contains the code for the explicit cell-cycle model for wild-type ER MCF7 cells and the drug effective model of palbociclib and fulvestrant.

"PD_model_DOXcells": This folder contains the code for the explicit cell-cycle model for ER mutant MCF7 cells and the drug effective model of palbociclib and fulvestrant.

"PD_model_Palbociclib_resistance": This folder contains the code for the explicit cell-cycle model for palbociclib-resistant MCF7 cells and the drug effective model of palbociclib and fulvestrant.

"In_silico_predictions": This folder contains the code for in silico clinical trial predictions of the standard pulsed treatment schedule and the proposed continuous treatment schedules using 100mg daily, 50/50mg BID, 75mg daily, 25/50mg BID dosages.

Each folder contains the necessary code to run its corresponding module in the project.
